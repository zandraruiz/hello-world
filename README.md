# hello-world
I am a writer and reader of things. I live in Denver. I travel back and forth between NJ and Philly often.

My interests are: TV, music, hiking, crochet, playing with my dog, and books (fiction and poetry). You can often find me lounging by the pool reading a book, or at home making playlists.
